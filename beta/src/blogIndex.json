While the use cases are not common and there are other ways to achieve this, we decided that it’s still valuable to support. So we’re now building <code>react-dom-server.js</code>, which will be shipped to Bower and in the <code>dist/</code> directory of the <code>react-dom</code> package on npm. This file works the same way as <code>react-dom.js</code> and therefore requires that the primary React build has already been included on the page.</p>\n",

Luckily it was only the development build, so your production applications were unaffected. This release is mostly to address those issues. There is one notable change if consuming React from npm. For the <code>react-dom</code> package, we moved <code>react</code> from a regular dependency to a peer dependency. This will impact very few people as these two are typically installed together at the top level, but it will fix some issues with dependencies of installed components also using <code>react</code> as a peer dependency.</p>\n",

A carefully crafted piece of content could result in arbitrary JS execution. While we make a very concerted effort to ensure all text is escaped before inserting it into the DOM, we missed one case. Immediately following the discovery of this vulnerability, we performed an audit to ensure we this was the only such vulnerability.</p>\n",
