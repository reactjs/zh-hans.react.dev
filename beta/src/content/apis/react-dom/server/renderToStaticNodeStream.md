<Intro>

Similar to renderToNodeStream, except this doesnâ€™t create extra DOM attributes that React uses internally, such as `data-reactroot`. This is useful if you want to use React as a simple static page generator, as stripping away the extra attributes can save some bytes.


```js
renderToStaticNodeStream(element)
```
