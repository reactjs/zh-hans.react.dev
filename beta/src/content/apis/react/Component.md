<Intro>

React lets you define components as classes:

```js
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
```

The only method you must define in a `React.Component` subclass is called `render()`. All the other methods described on are optional. Please see the old [React.Component](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html) docs for more info.
