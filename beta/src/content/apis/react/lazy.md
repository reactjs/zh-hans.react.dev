<Intro>

`React.lazy()` lets you define a component that is loaded dynamically. This helps reduce the bundle size to delay loading components that arenâ€™t used during the initial render.

```js
// This component is loaded dynamically
const SomeComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./SomeComponent'));
```
