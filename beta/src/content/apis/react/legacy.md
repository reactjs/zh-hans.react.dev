* [`Component`](/apis/react/Component) lets you define a React component as a JavaScript class. [See alternatives.](/apis/react/Component#alternatives)
* [`createElement`](/apis/react/createElement) lets you create a React element. Typically, you'll use JSX instead.
* [`createRef`](/apis/react/createRef) creates a ref object which can contain arbitrary value. [See alternatives.](/apis/react/createRef#alternatives)
