## What is this site?

We are rewriting the React documentation with a few differences:

- All explanations are **written using Hooks** rather than classes.
- We've added **interactive examples** and visual diagrams.
- Guides include **challenges (with solutions!)** to check your understanding.

This beta website contains the current draft of the new docs.

## This is a work in progress!

This is a **beta website**. There will be bugs, performance issues, and missing content.

## How much content is ready?

* [Learn React](/learn): ~70% finished.
* [API Reference](/reference): ~5% finished.

You can track our progress [on GitHub](https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues/3308).

## How can I provide feedback?

Please use [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues/3308) or [this anonymous form](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/Y6GH986) for high-level feedback. Additionally, each page has a Feedback button in the corner. If you spot something that doesn't make sense, please tell us!

## Will this site replace the main site?

We aim to switch this site to be the main one once we reach content parity with the [existing React documentation](https://reactjs.org/). The old React website will be archived at a subdomain so you'll still be able to access it. Old content links will redirect to the archived subdomain, which will have a notice about outdated content.
