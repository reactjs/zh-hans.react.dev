<Intro>

React development is led by a dedicated team working full time at Meta. It also receives contributions from people all over the world.

</Intro>

## React Core {/*react-core*/}

The React Core team members work full time on the core component APIs, the engine that powers React DOM and React Native, React DevTools, and the React documentation website.

Current members of the React team are listed in alphabetical order below.

<TeamMember name="Andrew Clark" permalink="andrew-clark" photo="/images/team/acdlite.jpg" github="acdlite" twitter="acdlite" title="Engineer at Vercel">
    Andrew got started with web development by making sites with WordPress, and eventually tricked himself into doing JavaScript. His favorite pastime is karaoke. Andrew is either a Disney villain or a Disney princess, depending on the day.

<TeamMember name="Andrey Lunyov" permalink="andrey-lunyov" photo="/images/team/andrey-lunyov.jpg" github="alunyov" twitter="alunyov" title="Engineer at Meta">
    Andrey started his career as a designer and then gradually transitioned into web development. After joining the React Data team at Meta he worked on adding an incremental JavaScript compiler to Relay, and then later on, worked on removing the same compiler from Relay. Outside of work, Andrey likes to play music and engage in various sports.

<TeamMember name="Mengdi Chen" permalink="mengdi-chen" photo="/images/team/mengdi-chen.jpg" github="mondaychen" twitter="mengdi_en" title="Engineer at Meta">
    While working on his Digital Arts degree Mengdi was conceited about his front-end skills because his CSS worked perfectly even on IE6. But soon React opened a new door of programming for him, and he has been dreaming of joining the React team ever since. Outside of work, he is usually busy chasing his two kids around or collecting strange recipes.

<TeamMember name="Sean Keegan" permalink="sean-keegan" photo="/images/team/sean-keegan.jpg" github="seanryankeegan" twitter="DevRelSean" title="Developer Advocate at Meta">
    After a first career as a math teacher, Sean remembered that one intro to comp sci class he had to take as a prereq and thought “that was kind of fun!”. One coding bootcamp and several tech jobs later, Sean discovered developer advocacy and hasn’t looked back. Outside of work, Sean enjoys ultimate frisbee, video games, and researching (but rarely implementing) better ways to care for his houseplants.

<TeamMember name="Sebastian Markbåge" permalink="sebastian-markbåge" photo="/images/team/sebmarkbage.jpg" github="sebmarkbage" twitter="sebmarkbage" title="Engineer at Vercel">
    Sebastian majored in psychology. He's usually quiet. Even when he says something, it often doesn't make sense to the rest of us until a few months later. The correct way to pronounce his surname is "mark-boa-geh" but he settled for "mark-beige" out of pragmatism -- and that's how he approaches React.
</TeamMember>

<TeamMember name="Sebastian Silbermann" permalink="sebastian-silbermann" photo="/images/team/sebsilbermann.jpg" github="eps1lon" twitter="sebsilbermann" title="Independent Engineer">
    Sebastian learned programming to make the browser games he played during class more enjoyable. Eventually this lead to contributing to as much open source code as possible. Outside of coding he's busy making sure people don't confuse him with the other Sebastians and Zilberman of the React community.
</TeamMember>

<TeamMember name="Seth Webster" permalink="seth-webster" photo="/images/team/seth.jpg" github="sethwebster" twitter="sethwebster" personal="sethwebster.com" title="Engineering Manager at Meta">
    Seth started programming as a kid growing up in Tucson, AZ. After school, he was bitten by the music bug and was a touring musician for about 10 years before returning to *work*, starting with Intuit. In his spare time, he loves [taking pictures](https://www.sethwebster.com) and flying for animal rescues in the northeastern United States.

<TeamMember name="Sophie Alpert" permalink="sophie-alpert" photo="/images/team/sophiebits.jpg" github="sophiebits" twitter="sophiebits" personal="sophiebits.com" title="Independent Engineer">
    Four days after React was released, Sophie rewrote the entirety of her then-current project to use it, which she now realizes was perhaps a bit reckless. After she became the project's #1 committer, she wondered why she wasn't getting paid by Facebook like everyone else was and joined the team officially to lead React through its adolescent years. Though she quit that job years ago, somehow she's still in the team's group chats and “providing value”.
</TeamMember>

<TeamMember name="Tianyu Yao" permalink="tianyu-yao" photo="/images/team/tianyu.jpg" github="tyao1" twitter="tianyu0" title="Engineer at Meta">
    Tianyu’s interest in computers started as a kid because he loves video games. So he majored in computer science and still plays childish games like League of Legends. When he is not in front of a computer, he enjoys playing with his two kittens, hiking and kayaking.
</TeamMember>

<TeamMember name="Yuzhi Zheng" permalink="yuzhi-zheng" photo="/images/team/yuzhi.jpg" github="yuzhi" twitter="yuzhiz" title="Engineering Manager at Meta">
    Yuzhi studied Computer Science in school. She liked the instant gratification of seeing code come to life without having to physically be in a laboratory. Now she’s a manager in the React org. Before management, she used to work on the Relay data fetching framework. In her spare time, Yuzhi enjoys optimizing her life via gardening and home improvement projects.
