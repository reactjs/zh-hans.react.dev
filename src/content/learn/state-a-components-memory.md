<Intro>

组件通常需要根据交互更改屏幕上显示的内容。输入表单应该更新输入字段，单击轮播图上的“下一个”应该更改显示的图片，单击“购买”应该将商品放入购物车。组件需要“记住”某些东西：当前输入值、当前图片、购物车。在 React 中，这种组件特有的记忆被称为 **state**。

以下是一个渲染雕塑图片的组件。点击 “Next” 按钮应该显示下一个雕塑并将 `index` 更改为 `1`，再次点击又更改为 `2`，以此类推。但这个组件现在**不起作用**（你可以试一试！）：

export default function Gallery() {
  let index = 0;

  function handleClick() {
    index = index + 1;
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (

`handleClick()` 事件处理函数正在更新局部变量 `index`。但存在两个原因使得变化不可见：

1. **局部变量无法在多次渲染中持久保存。** 当 React 再次渲染这个组件时，它会从头开始渲染——不会考虑之前对局部变量的任何更改。
2. **更改局部变量不会触发渲染。** React 没有意识到它需要使用新数据再次渲染组件。

要使用新数据更新组件，需要做两件事：

1. **保留** 渲染之间的数据。
2. **触发** React 使用新数据渲染组件（重新渲染）。

[`useState`](/reference/react/useState) Hook 提供了这两个功能：

1. **State 变量** 用于保存渲染间的数据。
2. **State setter 函数** 更新变量并触发 React 再次渲染组件。

## 添加一个 state 变量 {/*adding-a-state-variable*/}

要添加 state 变量，先从文件顶部的 React 中导入 `useState`：

```js
import { useState } from 'react';
```

然后，替换这一行：

```js
let index = 0;
```

将其修改为

```js
const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
```

`index` 是一个 state 变量，`setIndex` 是对应的 setter 函数。


> 这里的 `[` 和 `]` 语法称为[数组解构](/learn/a-javascript-refresher#array-destructuring)，它允许你从数组中读取值。 `useState` 返回的数组总是正好有两项。

以下展示了它们在 `handleClick()` 中是如何共同起作用的：

```js
function handleClick() {
  setIndex(index + 1);
}
```

现在点击 “Next” 按钮切换当前雕塑：

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { sculptureList } from './data.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);

  function handleClick() {
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Next

### 遇见你的第一个 Hook {/*meet-your-first-hook*/}

在 React 中，`useState` 以及任何其他以“`use`”开头的函数都被称为 **Hook**。

Hook 是特殊的函数，只在 React [渲染](/learn/render-and-commit#step-1-trigger-a-render)时有效（我们将在下一节详细介绍）。它们能让你 “hook” 到不同的 React 特性中去。

State 只是这些特性中的一个，你之后还会遇到其他 Hook。

<Pitfall>

**Hooks ——以 `use` 开头的函数——只能在组件或[自定义 Hook](/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks) 的最顶层调用。** 你不能在条件语句、循环语句或其他嵌套函数内调用 Hook。Hook 是函数，但将它们视为关于组件需求的无条件声明会很有帮助。在组件顶部 “use” React 特性，类似于在文件顶部“导入”模块。

</Pitfall>

### 剖析 `useState` {/*anatomy-of-usestate*/}

当你调用 [`useState`](/reference/react/useState) 时，你是在告诉 React 你想让这个组件记住一些东西：

```js
const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
```

在这个例子里，你希望 React 记住 `index`。

<Note>

惯例是将这对返回值命名为 `const [thing, setThing]`。你也可以将其命名为任何你喜欢的名称，但遵照约定俗成能使跨项目合作更易理解。

</Note>

`useState` 的唯一参数是 state 变量的**初始值**。在这个例子中，`index` 的初始值被`useState(0)`设置为 `0`。

每次你的组件渲染时，`useState` 都会给你一个包含两个值的数组：

1. **state 变量** (`index`) 会保存上次渲染的值。
2. **state setter 函数** (`setIndex`) 可以更新 state 变量并触发 React 重新渲染组件。

以下是实际发生的情况：

```js
const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
```

1. **组件进行第一次渲染。** 因为你将 `0` 作为 `index` 的初始值传递给 `useState`，它将返回 `[0, setIndex]`。 React 记住 `0` 是最新的 state 值。
2. **你更新了 state**。当用户点击按钮时，它会调用 `setIndex(index + 1)`。 `index` 是 `0`，所以它是 `setIndex(1)`。这告诉 React 现在记住 `index` 是 `1` 并触发下一次渲染。
3. **组件进行第二次渲染**。React 仍然看到 `useState(0)`，但是因为 React *记住* 了你将 `index` 设置为了 `1`，它将返回 `[1, setIndex]`。
4. 以此类推！

## 赋予一个组件多个 state 变量 {/*giving-a-component-multiple-state-variables*/}

你可以在一个组件中拥有任意多种类型的 state 变量。该组件有两个 state 变量，一个数字 `index` 和一个布尔值 `showMore`，点击 “Show Details” 会改变 `showMore` 的值：

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { sculptureList } from './data.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
  const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);

  function handleNextClick() {
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  function handleMoreClick() {
    setShowMore(!showMore);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleNextClick}>
        Next
      </button>
      <h2>
        <i>{sculpture.name} </i> 
        by {sculpture.artist}
      </h2>
      <h3>  
        ({index + 1} of {sculptureList.length})
      </h3>
      <button onClick={handleMoreClick}>
        {showMore ? 'Hide' : 'Show'} details
      </button>
      {showMore && <p>{sculpture.description}</p>}
      <img 
        src={sculpture.url} 
        alt={sculpture.alt}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

如果它们不相关，那么存在多个 state 变量是一个好主意，例如本例中的 `index` 和 `showMore`。但是，如果你发现经常同时更改两个 state 变量，那么最好将它们合并为一个。例如，如果你有一个包含多个字段的表单，那么有一个值为对象的 state 变量比每个字段对应一个 state 变量更方便。 [选择 state 结构](/learn/choosing-the-state-structure)在这方面有更多提示。

<DeepDive title="React 如何知道返回哪一个 state?">

#### React 如何知道返回哪个 state {/*how-does-react-know-which-state-to-return*/}

你可能已经注意到，`useState` 在调用时没有任何关于它引用的是*哪个* state 变量的信息。没有传递给 `useState` 的“标识符”，它是如何知道要返回哪个 state 变量呢？它是否依赖于解析函数之类的魔法？答案是否定的。

相反，为了使语法更简洁，**在同一组件的每次渲染中，Hooks 都依托于一个稳定的调用顺序**。这在实践中很有效，因为如果你遵循上面的规则（“只在顶层调用 Hooks”），Hooks 将始终以相同的顺序被调用。此外，[linter 插件](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks)也可以捕获大多数错误。

在 React 内部，为每个组件保存了一个数组，其中每一项都是一个 state 对。它维护当前 state 对的索引值，在渲染之前将其设置为 “0”。每次调用 useState 时，React 都会为你提供一个 state 对并增加索引值。你可以在文章 [React Hooks: not magic, just arrays](https://medium.com/@ryardley/react-hooks-not-magic-just-arrays-cd4f1857236e)中阅读有关此机制的更多信息。

这个例子**没有使用 React**，但它让你了解 `useState` 在内部是如何工作的：

<Sandpack>

```js index.js active
let componentHooks = [];
let currentHookIndex = 0;

// useState 在 React 中是如何工作的（简化版）
function useState(initialState) {
  let pair = componentHooks[currentHookIndex];
  if (pair) {
    // 这不是第一次渲染
    // 所以 state pair 已经存在
    // 将其返回并为下一次 hook 的调用做准备
    currentHookIndex++;
    return pair;
  }

  // 这是我们第一次进行渲染
  // 所以新建一个 state pair 然后存储它
  pair = [initialState, setState];

  function setState(nextState) {
    // 当用户发起 state 的变更，
    // 把新的值放入 pair 中
    pair[0] = nextState;
    updateDOM();
  }

  // 存储这个 pair 用于将来的渲染
  // 并且为下一次 hook 的调用做准备
  componentHooks[currentHookIndex] = pair;
  currentHookIndex++;
  return pair;
}

function Gallery() {
  // 每次调用 useState() 都会得到新的 pair
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
  const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);

  function handleNextClick() {
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  function handleMoreClick() {
    setShowMore(!showMore);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  // 这个例子没有使用 React，所以
  // 返回一个对象而不是 JSX
  return {

## State 是隔离且私有的 {/*state-is-isolated-and-private*/}

State 是屏幕上组件实例内部的状态。换句话说，**如果你渲染同一个组件两次，每个副本都会有完全隔离的 state**！改变其中一个不会影响另一个。

在这个例子中，之前的 `Gallery` 组件以同样的逻辑被渲染了两次。试着点击每个画廊内的按钮。你会注意到它们的 state 是相互独立的：

<Sandpack>

```js
import Gallery from './Gallery.js';

  );
}

```

```js Gallery.js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { sculptureList } from './data.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
  const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);

  function handleNextClick() {
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  function handleMoreClick() {
    setShowMore(!showMore);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <section>

这就是 state 与声明在模块顶部的普通变量不同的原因。 State 不依赖于特定的函数调用或在代码中的位置，它的作用域“只限于”屏幕上的某块特定区域。你渲染了两个 `<Gallery />` 组件，所以它们的 state 是分别存储的。

还要注意 `Page` 组件“不知道”关于 `Gallery` state 的任何信息，甚至不知道它是否有任何 state。与 props 不同，**state 完全私有于声明它的组件**。父组件无法更改它。这使你可以向任何组件添加或删除 state，而不会影响其他组件。

如果你希望两个画廊保持其 states 同步怎么办？在 React 中执行此操作的正确方法是从子组件中*删除* state 并将其添加到离它们最近的共享父组件中。接下来的几节将专注于组织单个组件的 state，但我们将在[组件间共享 state](/learn/sharing-state-between-components) 中回到这个主题。

<Recap>

* 当一个组件需要在多次渲染间“记住”某些信息时使用 state 变量。
* State 变量是通过调用 `useState` Hook 来声明的。
* Hook 是以 `use` 开头的特殊函数。它们能让你 “hook” 到像 state 这样的 React 特性中。
* Hook 可能会让你想起 import：它们需要在非条件语句中调用。调用 Hook 时，包括 `useState`，仅在组件或另一个 Hook 的顶层被调用才有效。
* `useState` Hook 返回一对值：当前 state 和更新它的函数。
* 你可以拥有多个 state 变量。在内部，React 按顺序匹配它们。
* State 是组件私有的。如果你在两个地方渲染它，则每个副本都有独属于自己的 state。

</Recap>



<Challenges>

#### 完成画廊组件 {/*complete-the-gallery*/}

当你在最后一个雕塑上按 “Next” 时，代码会发生崩溃。请修复逻辑以防止此崩溃。你可以尝试在事件处理函数中添加额外的逻辑，或在操作无法执行时禁用掉按钮。

修复崩溃后，添加一个显示上一个雕塑的 “Previous” 按钮。同样地，确保它不在第一个雕塑里发生崩溃。

注意 `hasPrev` 和 `hasNext` 是如何*同时* 作用于返回的 JSX 和事件处理函数中的！这种简便的模式之所以有效，是因为事件处理函数["闭包"](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures)了渲染时声明的变量。

#### 修复卡住的输入表单 {/*fix-stuck-form-inputs*/}

当你输入字段时，什么也没有出现。这就像输入值被空字符串给“卡住”了。第一个 `<input>` 的 `value` 设置为始终匹配 `firstName` 变量，第二个 `<input>` 的 `value` 设置为始终匹配 `lastName` 变量。这是对的。两个输入框都有 `onChange` 事件处理函数，它尝试根据最新的用户输入（`e.target.value`）更新变量。但是，变量似乎并没有在重新渲染时“记住”它们的值。通过使用 state 变量来解决此问题。

<Sandpack>

```js
export default function Form() {
  let firstName = '';
  let lastName = '';

  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
    firstName = e.target.value;
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(e) {
    lastName = e.target.value;
  }

  function handleReset() {
    firstName = '';
    lastName = '';
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={e => e.preventDefault()}>
      <input
        placeholder="First name"
        value={firstName}
        onChange={handleFirstNameChange}
      />
      <input
        placeholder="Last name"
        value={lastName}
        onChange={handleLastNameChange}
      />
      <h1>Hi, {firstName} {lastName}</h1>
      <button onClick={handleReset}>Reset</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

```css 
h1 { margin-top: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

首先，从 React 导入 `useState`。然后用 `useState` 声明的 state 变量替换 `firstName` 和 `lastName`。最后，用 `setFirstName(...)` 替换每个 `firstName = ...` 赋值，并对 `lastName` 做同样的事情。不要忘记更新 `handleReset`，以使重置按钮生效。

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('');

  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
    setFirstName(e.target.value);
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(e) {
    setLastName(e.target.value);
  }

  function handleReset() {
    setFirstName('');
    setLastName('');
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={e => e.preventDefault()}>
      <input
        placeholder="First name"
        value={firstName}
        onChange={handleFirstNameChange}
      />
      <input
        placeholder="Last name"
        value={lastName}
        onChange={handleLastNameChange}
      />
      <h1>Hi, {firstName} {lastName}</h1>
      <button onClick={handleReset}>Reset</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

```css 
h1 { margin-top: 10px; }
```

#### 修复一个错误 {/*fix-a-crash*/}

这是一个收集用户反馈的小表单。当反馈被提交时，它应该显示一条感谢信息。但是，现在它会发生崩溃并显示错误消息“渲染的 hooks 比预期的少”。你能发现错误并修复它吗？

<Hint>

Hook 只允许在*什么地方* 调用？这个组件是否违反了任何规则？检查是否有注释禁用了 linter 检查--这往往是 bug 的藏身之处！

</Hint>

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function FeedbackForm() {
  const [isSent, setIsSent] = useState(false);
  if (isSent) {
    return <h1>Thank you!</h1>;
  } else {
    // eslint-disable-next-line
    const [message, setMessage] = useState('');
    return (
      <form onSubmit={e => {
        e.preventDefault();
        alert(`Sending: "${message}"`);
        setIsSent(true);
      }}>
        <textarea
          placeholder="Message"
          value={message}
          onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)}
        />
        <br />
        <button type="submit">Send</button>
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

Hook 只能在组件函数的顶层调用。这里，第一个 `isSent` 定义遵循这个规则，但是 `message` 的定义位于一个条件语句中。

将其移出条件语句以解决问题：

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function FeedbackForm() {
  const [isSent, setIsSent] = useState(false);
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  if (isSent) {
    return <h1>Thank you!</h1>;
  } else {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={e => {
        e.preventDefault();
        alert(`Sending: "${message}"`);
        setIsSent(true);
      }}>
        <textarea
          placeholder="Message"
          value={message}
          onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)}
        />
        <br />
        <button type="submit">Send</button>
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```

</Sandpack>

请记住，必须在条件语句外并且始终以相同的顺序调用 Hook！


你还可以删除不必要的 `else` 分支以减少嵌套。但要保证对 Hook 的所有调用都发生在第一个 `return` **前**，这很重要。

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function FeedbackForm() {
  const [isSent, setIsSent] = useState(false);
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  if (isSent) {
    return <h1>Thank you!</h1>;
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={e => {
      e.preventDefault();
      alert(`Sending: "${message}"`);
      setIsSent(true);
    }}>
      <textarea
        placeholder="Message"
        value={message}
        onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)}
      />
      <br />
      <button type="submit">Send</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

尝试移动第二个 `useState` 调用到 `if` 条件之后，并要注意这会如何再次破坏它。

通常，以上类型的错误都会由 [`eslint-plugin-react-hooks`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks) linter 规则捕获。如果在本地调试错误代码时没有看到错误，则需要在构建工具的配置文件中进行设置。

</Solution>

#### 移除不必要的 state {/*remove-unnecessary-state*/}

当按钮被点击时，这个例子应该询问用户的名字，然后显示一个 alert 欢迎他们。你尝试使用 state 来保存名字，但由于某种原因，它始终显示“Hello, ！”。


要修复此代码，请删除不必要的 state 变量。（我们将在稍后讨论[为什么上述代码不起作用](/learn/state-as-a-snapshot)。）

你能解释为什么这个 state 变量是不必要的吗？

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function FeedbackForm() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');

  function handleClick() {
    setName(prompt('What is your name?'));
    alert(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Greet
    </button>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

以下是一个使用了普通变量 `name` 的固定版本，这个变量声明于需要它的函数中。

<Sandpack>

```js
export default function FeedbackForm() {
  function handleClick() {
    const name = prompt('What is your name?');
    alert(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Greet
    </button>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

State 变量仅用于在组件重渲染时保存信息。在单个事件处理函数中，普通变量就足够了。当普通变量运行良好时，不要引入 state 变量。

</Solution>
